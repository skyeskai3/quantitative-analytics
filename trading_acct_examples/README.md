# Trading Account Examples
The examples in this folder are meant to demonstrate the trading strategies that I was able to develop by utilizing a combination of research and analysis of proprietary variables along with analysis of public stock market data. 

In addition to these trading account examples, I instituted many trading strategies at the request of a client. The client would make note of "moves" they wanted automated after utilizing our proprietary charts, and I would translate these requests into tradable, automated algorithms. 

I also helped to implement some of the risk management strategies that were in place while these accounts were actively trading, such as active account monitoring (halting trades after certain time periods, halting trades after a certain percentage of profit was reached, etc.). Additionally, I helped manage and validate our news sentiment analysis which aided in risk management (halting trades when well known news events were set to occur i.e. FOMC Meetings, Rate Decision Meetings, etc.).
