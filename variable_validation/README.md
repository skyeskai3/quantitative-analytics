# Variable Validation Project
This small program was designed to assist in validating the backfilling of data of proprietary variables. The program would output a list of minimum and maximum values per variable actoss a multitude of years to identify gaps in data, incorrect values, and incorrect data types. 

Please note that the imported helper functions have been obfuscated and are a part of a greater proprietary system, so this program will not run as designed if pulled in the current state.
